<hr />
<h3>The Intern</h3> 
<p>The Intern is a fantastic movie, I love how Ben and Julie start off as strangers and end up being best friends</p>
<h3>Wall-e</h3> 
<p>One of my favorite animated movies of all time. Wall-e is so cute and innocent.</p>
<h3>The Iron Giant</h3>
<p>I was afraid of this movie as a child but have grown to love it as an adult. The giant robot is so funny.</p>
